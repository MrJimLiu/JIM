    <h3>France strikes: May Day rioters accused of trying to kill police after 400 officers injured</h3>
    <p>
        <em>
            The French government has accused rioters of trying to murder police officers after 406 were injured in Paris and other cities in May Day protests against President Macron’s two-year increase in the pension age.

            Announcing the figure and the arrest of 291 people, Gérald Darmanin, the interior minister, blamed far-left radicals known as “black blocs”, who attacked police and property on the margins of trade union marches. About 2,000 of the black-clad rioters were active in Paris, including one group that threw petrol bombs at police on the Boulevard Voltaire, where one officer suffered serious burns.

            “The vast majority of protesters were peaceful, but in Paris, Lyons and Nantes notably, police officers came up against extremely violent wreckers who had one objective: kill a police officer and to attack the property of others,” Darmanin said.
